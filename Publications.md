Below you can find a list of my published journal and conference articles.
Each publication is accompanied by a small abstract, BibTex code and a DOI/URL.
The red stars (<span style="color:red">\*</span>) indicate joint authorship. 
A list of my publications can be also found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LvApgFAAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.
