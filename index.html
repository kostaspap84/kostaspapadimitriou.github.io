Here you can find material and information related to my research and one of my hobbies (i.e. coding).<br/><br/>

I am an ECE graduate with an M.Sc. and PhD in biomedical engineering and analogue IC design. Programming is an integral part of my research. Most of my projects involve programming in C, C++, Matlab, VHDL and Python. I am also a GNU/Linux enthusiast... :-)  <br/><br/>

I have lots of interesting things lined up so please check back often for updates.
